# Wednesday 30.5.

1. New github repository and R project: PH14.02.Factsheets

2. Inspiration: IIASA Ageing Demographic Data Sheet - but turns out not really, althought it's really cool what they do with prospective age and stuff, it's not sth that is easy to run I think, since it requires annual data, which I don't have. 

3. Oh, no, actually it looks like it is available: [Population interpolated by single age, annually from 1950 to 2100.](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/), downloaded into `data/raw`, we'll see how interested anyone is in that!

4. OK, copy makefile from last one and copy out all the bespoke stuff. 

5. `make dot`, `make journal`, `make readme` all work. 

6. readme was giving a warning that it requires a nonempty title or pagetitle, so i added a yaml, even though i didn't used to have one. I mean it worked either way, but now there's no warning. 

7. OK, program for data download so it only happens once. 


# Thursday 1.6.

1. OK, so download script is in separate file, so won't need to be run again, then touched the .csv file, so the order is now correct. If I end up downloading any more stuff, just touch it and it will be newer than the prerequisite `00-download`. 

2. I need list of countries in .csv format
