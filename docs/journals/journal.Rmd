# Wednesday 30.5.

1. New github repository and R project: PH14.02.Factsheets

2. Inspiration: IIASA Ageing Demographic Data Sheet - but turns out not really, althought it's really cool what they do with prospective age and stuff, it's not sth that is easy to run I think, since it requires annual data, which I don't have. 

3. Oh, no, actually it looks like it is available: [Population interpolated by single age, annually from 1950 to 2100.](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/), downloaded into `data/raw`, we'll see how interested anyone is in that!

4. OK, copy makefile from last one and copy out all the bespoke stuff. 

5. `make dot`, `make journal`, `make readme` all work. 

6. readme was giving a warning that it requires a nonempty title or pagetitle, so i added a yaml, even though i didn't used to have one. I mean it worked either way, but now there's no warning. 

7. OK, program for data download so it only happens once. 


# Thursday 1.6.

1. OK, so download script is in separate file, so won't need to be run again, then touched the .csv file, so the order is now correct. If I end up downloading any more stuff, just touch it and it will be newer than the prerequisite `00-download`. 

2. I need list of countries in .csv format, manually `cntry.list.csv` in `/raw`,

3. `01-import.R` script to import full WPP population total dataset, extract the countries and save to rds. as processed. 


# Monday 4.6. 

1. After  consulting with Hafiz to exclude mauritania and western sahara and keep turkey. which is nice, since that leaves 20 countries, which should be easy to lay out. Removed the two countries from the country list. 

# Tuesday 5.6.

1. New code script `02-clean-data.R` To set up the data for plotting. 

2. Ach, the dowload scripts are super problematic if they download more than a single file - then if you update the script it always has to redownload all of them. So instead let's put the downloads into the makefile directly as unix commands. 

3. Here's one suggested [solution with curl](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32672222/how-to-download-a-file-only-if-more-recently-changed-in-makefile) instead of wget. 

4. Well, wget doesn't work on this windows machine anyway, so let's try curl then. And no need to complicate my life with the temp files. Hmm, but it doesn't work with just the file as a target and the curl command as a rule, says "no rule"?! 

5. My bad, there was no rule, because i didn't add the folder. 

6. OK: this is how it works: `curl -o new.filename http://xxx.com` as a rule, 

7. Mini sidetrack trying out multiple cursors in rstudio. nice trick. Although a small bug, since multiline lines are not treated as single lines, which you might presumably expect, no?

8. OK, now the question is how to figure out the old-age threshold, since the life tables data is for 5-year groups. So I need a funciton to get the intercept and slope from two points and then get me the age at which ex is 15. Maybe not linear interpolation either, how about splines? Let's see.

9. Fuck Yes. Splines first attempt with fmm is correct to second decimal compared to the Ageing datasheet from IIASA. 

10. Althought that's actually suspicious. What if they didn't actually make an error? because I am now using the start of the age group, not the middle of the group. So the life expectancy of the group e.g. 50-54 is plotted as the expectancy of 50 year-olds, which is actually wrong, it should be the middle of the group? Actually no, checked in the Andy Hinde book, it is correct . I'll double check a few other country/year combos?

11. Manually checking a few countries to see which method of spline to use. China and Togo 45-50 fit with MonoH.FC method, so does Algeria and Israel, so I'm happy using this. 

# Wednesday 6.6. 

1. OK, keep makefile up to date. `01-import` is now importing and reducing two .csv files, produces two rds files (one is connected via simple dependency only) and these are now inputs to `02-clean`. 

2. OK, so now in data clean we need to write a function to get the old age threshold for each country/year/gender combo. Also write it up in teh methods.

3. How do you do bibtex in knitted docs again? Ah, OK, that's easy.

4. OK, now write a function to interpolate a single value, using splines, from vectors x and y. And make a very nice roxy example, this in itself could be a blog post about how splines work!

5. Add `FunSPline.R` to makefile. 

6. Clean data for old age threshold plots. 

7. Write draft fundtion for plotting old age thresholds. One for each country, the other 20 totals in the background, and male and female added on top. 

8. Find proportion of population over 65, then proportion over threshold! OK, so this is the population files, and here the issue is that up to a point there was an open ended group fot "80+" peeps. Which is not a number. 

9. OK, now in order to get the proportionof the population over the old age threshold I first need the thresholds for each year. Done

10. Now I need to get the population over that age in each Location/year combination. Got it, that's now an extra row in the population table. 

11. Next step is splitting the year into two rows properly - atm the interpolated population is in the table twice, once as the proportion, and once as part of teh whole population for that age. 

# Thursday 7.6. 

1. OOps, go back one step. The old-age thrshold was calculated for teh abridged life table, so every 5 years, let's fill in the intervening years as well. That makes teh chart smoother.

2. Now restart the population interpolation. I've got it all in one table now, and interpolated

3. Now need to split the full year into the interpolated and difference: If the threshold is 57.3, and there were 30,000 people in the 57 age group, there are now x in the 57.3 age group and 30,000-x in the 57 age group. So some sort of lag function to work only on these two rows. 

4. OK, so I figured that, but there is an issue..Once I plot the proportion over/under the threshold, the fact that I had interpolated to get the five year individual year data is now super obvious and all jumpy.. So I think I may have to go back to five year data here. Oh, or isntead of interpolating the populations, I should only interpolate the proportions, i.e. at the last step. 

8. Smooth pipeline from 02 -> 03 and update makefile.
